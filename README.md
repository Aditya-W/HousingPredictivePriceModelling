# Housing Price Prediction

This repository contains code and documentation for a housing price prediction project utilizing machine learning techniques to estimate property prices based on various features. The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), modeling using multiple regression and ensemble techniques, and empirical insights derived from the models.


# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict housing prices accurately using machine learning models. 

## The project includes:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Utilization of various regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet) and ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation
Empirical insights and analysis of model performance

# Dependencies
The code is written in Python and requires the following dependencies:

NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
